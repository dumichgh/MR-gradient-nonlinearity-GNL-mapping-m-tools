# MR-gradient-nonlinearity-GNL-mapping-m-tools
Matlab toolbox for 3D mapping of MR gradient fields and nonlinearity tensor using spherical harmonics (SPH) model.
The toolbox contains two m-libraries for Bz field mapping of MR gradeints (gbzmap_comboR5.m)
and for contrustion of GNL tensor (gnlmap_comboR3, see Bammer et al. MRM 2003).
The Bz-mapping is based on system SPH coefficients and is described in the manual, while specific script usage 
details are provided in the corresponding README...txt files. The repository also contains the "DEMO" directory
with examples of input SPH coefficients, and p-code for "build_mhd_combo" library to create MHD output 3D volumes.
